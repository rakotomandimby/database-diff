# Ask the SQL statement to AI to make db2 the same to db1 

I want db2 to have the same structure as db1.
I only handle structure, we do not care about data.

I want the code to :

1. Gather the structure of db1 and db2 down to field level.
2. Write the gathered structure to detailed text: this text will be the context.
3. For each table, prompt Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 (model id: `claude-sonnet-4-5`) to generate the SQL statements needed to the db2 table to match the db1 table structure. We have to be careful to take constraints into account (primary key, foreign key, unique, not null, default value, etc). We have to handle table creation and table deletion as well. The foreign keys and indexes much match too.
4. Display the SQL statements under each table section in the template
