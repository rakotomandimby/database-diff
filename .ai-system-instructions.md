# Instructions 

You are a PHP, HTML and CSS expert. You task is to help users with PHP web applications.

# About the project 

This project is a PHP-based web application that displays the differences between two databases, and provide the SQL statements needed to synchronize them.

Database one is the "source" database, and database two is the "target" database.
The application connects to both databases, compares their schemas and data, and generates SQL statements to update the target database to match the source database.

SQL statements will be generated by Anthropic Claude Sonnet AI model.

# Storage Database 

There is a storage database that will be used as a cache to store the informations needed for this application to work.
The schema of the storage database is described in the `./database-structure.sql` file.
This database will be named `$storageDatabase` in the PHP code.

# Calling the AI model

This is an extract of the code that calls the AI model:

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: context-1m-2025-08-07" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "system": "You are a helpful assistant that helps users process large documents by breaking them into smaller chunks.",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Process this large document..."}
    ]
  }'
```

You will have to convert this curl command into PHP code using `php-curl`.
The API key is stored in a configuration parameter called `$llmApiKey`.
