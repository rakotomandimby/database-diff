# About the project 

This project is a PHP-based web application that displays the differences between two databases, and provide the SQL statements needed to synchronize them.

Database one is the "source" database, and database two is the "target" database.
The application connects to both databases, compares their schemas and data, and generates SQL statements to update the target database to match the source database.

SQL statements will be generated by Anthropic Claude Sonnet AI model.

# Calling the AI model

This is an extract of the code that calls the AI model:

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: context-1m-2025-08-07" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "system": "You are a helpful assistant that helps users process large documents by breaking them into smaller chunks.",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Process this large document..."}
    ]
  }'
```

You will have to convert this curl command into PHP code using `php-curl`.
The API key is stored in a configuration parameter called `$llmApiKey`.
